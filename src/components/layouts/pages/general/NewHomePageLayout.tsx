            <AboutText>
              Welcome to my digital space! I'm a prompt engineer at Olive Person who transitioned from 
              full-stack development into the fascinating world of AI and language models. I believe in 
              the power of well-crafted prompts to unlock AI's potential and create meaningful solutions.

            <AboutText>
              My journey began in full-stack development with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern web 
              technologies. This technical foundation now empowers me to approach prompt engineering with 
              a deep understanding of how systems work, enabling me to design more effective AI interactions.

          <AboutText>
            My transition from full-stack development to prompt engineering has been one of the most rewarding 
            career moves I've made. It combines my love for technical precision with the art of communication, 
            allowing me to explore how language shapes AI behavior and capabilities.
          </AboutText>
          <AboutText>
            I'm fascinated by the evolving relationship between humans and AI systems. When I'm not designing 
            prompts, I enjoy reading about cognitive science, linguistics, and the philosophy of artificial 
            intelligence. These interests directly inform my approach to creating more intuitive AI interactions.
