            <AboutText>
              My journey started early with an internship at Bank Millennium, developing iOS apps including Goodie 
              (discount platform), where I learned clean code practices, API integration, and teamwork fundamentals. 
              This experience motivated me to pursue a BSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen, 
              studying AI fundamentals including computer vision, neural networks, and robotics.

            <AboutText>
              While studying at university, I began working at Sigbar in 2019, where I worked until 2021 on diverse 
              projects from iOS/tvOS narrowcasting systems for healthcare to AR shop applications and React web development. 
              After university, I moved into consulting at Usprawniacze Firm, helping companies like Planeta Soni, ZIO-MAX, 
              and SteelProfil improve their processes through automation and software solutions, including developing AI agents.

            <AboutText>
              Alongside my consulting work, I contributed to BrainGym.AI's learning platform and Blue Owl's Shopify 
              commerce solutions, before transitioning fully into prompt engineering at LivePerson. This diverse 
              experience across industries and technologies has shaped my approach to building AI solutions that 
              solve real-world business challenges.
