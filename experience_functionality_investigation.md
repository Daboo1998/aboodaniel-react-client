# Experience Add/Remove Functionality - Investigation Results

## Summary
**Yes, there was definitely an option to add/remove experiences before, but it has been intentionally disabled.**

## What I Found

### 1. **The functionality still exists in the codebase**
- `ExperiencePageLayout` component (`src/components/layouts/pages/general/ExperiencePageLayout.tsx`) is fully implemented
- Contains both "Add experience" and "Remove experiences" buttons for authenticated owners
- Both `AddExperiencePopup` and `RemoveExperiencesPopup` components exist and are functional
- Complete CRUD operations for experiences are implemented with Firebase database integration

### 2. **When it was removed**
Based on the git history, the experience page was removed in a recent commit with the message:
```
"few fixes and removed experience page as its outdated"
```

### 3. **What was specifically disabled**
In `src/App.tsx`, these lines were commented out:

**Navigation link:**
```jsx
{/* <PageNavigatorBarLink to="/experience">
    Experience
</PageNavigatorBarLink> */}
```

**Route:**
```jsx
{/* <Route exact path="/experience">
    <ExperiencePageLayout />
</Route> */}
```

**Import:**
```jsx
// import ExperiencePageLayout from "./components/layouts/pages/general/ExperiencePageLayout";
```

### 4. **The experience functionality included:**
- **Add Experience**: Full form with title, dates, importance, and description
- **Remove Experiences**: Multi-select deletion with confirmation
- **Display**: Sorted by importance with expandable content
- **Authentication**: Only visible to authenticated owners
- **Firebase Integration**: Complete database operations

## Current Status
- All the code is intact and functional
- The page was deliberately disabled, likely because it was considered "outdated"
- You can still see experience data on the CV page (`/cv`), but without admin controls
- The experience data structure and database collection still exist

## To Re-enable
If you want to restore this functionality, you would need to:
1. Uncomment the import in `App.tsx`
2. Uncomment the navigation link
3. Uncomment the route
4. Optionally update/modernize the UI if that was the concern

The functionality was quite comprehensive with proper authentication, form validation, and database operations.
